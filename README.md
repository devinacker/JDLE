JMickle's Doom Lump Editor

Requirements:
https://github.com/jmickle1/omgifol

A simple lump viewing/editing tool, built in Python on top of the Omgifol library.

Built as a personal project for experimental or proof-of-concept lump editing features. 
Slade 3 (http://slade.mancubus.net/) is still king in terms of lump editing, and I don't intend to try and replace it :~)
