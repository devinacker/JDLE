JMickle's Doom Lump Editor

Requirements:
https://github.com/jmickle1/omgifol

A simple lump viewing/editing tool, built in Python on top of the Omgifol library.
Early WIP

Current Features:
- Load .wad files and view lumps
- Text and image previews
- /idgames protocol for viewing wads from the database

Planned Features:
- Previews for many more lump types
- External editor settings for all lump-types for ease of editing
- Option to open wads in source ports and other editors, such as Doombuilder or Slade
- Simple editors for various lump types

Built as a personal project for experimental or proof-of-concept lump editing features. 
Slade 3 (http://slade.mancubus.net/) is still king in terms of lump editing, and I don't intend to try and replace it :~)
